#Pitchfork Client

An unofficial Node.js client for [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/) reviews based on the [Pitchfork API Client for Python](https://github.com/michalczaplinski/pitchfork).

## Install

### Using NPM
```bash
npm install pitchfork
```
### Using Github
```bash
git clone git@github.com:omardelarosa/pitchfork-npm.git
```
You can then use it as a [command-line tool](#CLI) or as a [node module](#API)

##API

You can require ``pitchfork`` and use it inside of any Node.JS application.

```javascript
var p4k = require('pitchfork')
```

### Search

A {Search} constructor that extends [EventEmitter](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_events_eventemitter).  Listeners can be attached to the 'ready' event which will fire when all reviews have been fetched and parsed.  For example:

```javascript

var p = require('pitchfork')
var s = new p.Search('wilco')

s.on('ready', function(results){
  console.log("results", results)
})

//=> [ {Review}, {Review}, {Review}, ... ]
```

``.results``

An {Array} of {Review} objects.

``.init``

Called once when Search is instantiated to fetch results.  Not usually called directly

### Review

The {Review} constructor encapsulates methods and data relating to the Pitchfork review.  The {Review} extends {EventEmitter} and fires a 'ready' event when the review has been fetched and parsed.


``.attributes``

An {Object} with information about the album and its text.  Sample below:

```json
{
  "url": "/reviews/albums/9419-the-letting-go/",
  "name": "Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy - The Letting Go",
  "artist": "Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy",
  "album": "The Letting Go",
  "title": "Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy: The Letting Go | Album Reviews | Pitchfork",
  "label": "Palace / Drag City",
  "year": "2006",
  "score": 8.2,
  "cover": "http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/9255/homepage_large.e8a2bd20.jpg",
  "author": "Mark Richardson",
  "date": "September 18, 2006",
  "text": " Though Will Oldham began his musical career while in his early twenties, he's never exactly sounded young. From his first releases as Palace Music, Oldham's whiskey-soaked vocals and lyrical obsessions with death, sex, and religion have made \"maturity\" something of a non-issue. And yet, with his mo..."
}
```

``.fetch``

This method is automatically called when the {Review} is instantiated and returns a [Promise](https://github.com/kriskowal/q).  This generally isn't called directly.

``.promise``

This stores the thennable promise object generated by .fetch for attaching .then-style callbacks.


``.verbose``

The full {Review} instance represented as JSON.


``.truncated``

The attributes of the {Review} instance with editorial.html/editorial.text condensed into the first 300 characters of of the text assigned to the key '.text'.

``.text_pretty_print``

Prints a plain-text representation of the review.


## CLI (Command-Line Interface)

Returns a review for a given artist.

```bash

$ pitchfork -a 'wilco' -t 'yankee hotel foxtrot'

```
